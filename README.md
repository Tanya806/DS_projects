#My Data Science projects

#Project 2 - Preliminary analysis of communication rates:
  
  Clients of a certain mobile operator are offered two tariff plans ("Smart" and "Ultra"). To adjust the advertising budget, 
  the commercial department of the mobile operator wants to understand which tariff brings the most money.
  It is required to do a preliminary analysis of tariffs for a small sample of customers. 
  We have at our disposal the data of 500 clients: who they are, where they are from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent per year. 
  It is necessary to analyze the behavior of customers and draw a conclusion - which tariff is better.
  
#Project 4 - Identifying patterns that determine the commercial success of computer games:

  The research client is an online store that sells computer games all over the world. 
  Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. 
  It is required to identify the patterns that determine the commercial success of a computer game. 
  This will allow you to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.
  
#Project 5 - Forecasting the churn of bank customers

  Clients began to leave the commercial bank. Every month. A little, but noticeable. 
  Bank marketers figured it was cheaper to retain current customers than to attract new ones.
  It is necessary to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. 
  You have been provided with historical data on customer behavior and termination of agreements with the bank.
  Build a model with an extremely high F1-measure. To deliver the project successfully, you need to bring the metric to 0.59. 
  Check the F1-measure on the test set yourself. Additionally measure the AUC-ROC, compare its value with the F1-measure.
